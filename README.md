# Super Mario Bros. 3 Spade House Minigame

*Do you love the spade house roulette minigame from Mario 3? I doubt it, but here's a web version of it you can play anyways!*

This isn't a perfect recreation, but in a way that's good because it isn't rigged (on purpose). I still need to add space between the selections/make them actually touch the border (I don't know why this is so hard for me), fix the choppy looping at the top and bottom, and improve the stopping logic in general.

**Hit space to stop the roulette. Once it's over, you can just reset the game by pressing space again.**
