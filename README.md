# Super Mario Bros. 3 Spade House Minigame

*Do you love the spade house roulette minigame from Mario 3? I doubt it, but here's a web version of it you can play anyways!*

This isn't a perfect recreation, but in a way that's good because it isn't rigged (at least on purpose, the stopping logic isn't perfect and it doesn't go around once more like in SMB3).

**Hit space to stop the roulette. Once it's over, you can just reset the game by pressing space again.**
